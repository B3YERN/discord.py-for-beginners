'''Welcome back! this lesson will go on working with booleans.
"Wait so what are Booleans?"
booleans are a type of "state" we can say, so the program tells whenever the value is True or not
Here we will get into the shell and do our comparisons:
>>> 1==1                                           True
>>> #now lets return a false one
...
>>> 1!=1
False
>>>
so you can see that i did 1==1 which means 1=1 in human readable and it returned to "True", While the 2nd one i did (1!=1) is 1â‰ 1 in human readable and it returned to "False"
so now you can tell what a bool is, you can also return a bool by definding it with variable
Heres an example:
>>> state = True
>>> print(state)
True
>>> positive = False
>>> print(positive)
False
>>>exit()
$'''

'''Now when we do actually get what a boolean is, lets start with breaking a line!
so here lets try printing a new line:'''

print("A New \nLine")

'''The \n is this where it tells to break a line! now lets put it in our program and output it!:
>>> print ("A New \nLine")
A New
Line
>>> exit()
$
You see the reson we put it like this "...\nLine" is because we do not want any spacing into the line!'''

'''in the next one we will discuss about the if statement! So just hop in!'''
