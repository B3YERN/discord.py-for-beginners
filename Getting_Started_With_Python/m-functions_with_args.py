values = 7#<- ignore that since it wont output
'''Hey, lets start with functions again, this time we are doing it with arguements!
the syntax for it is:'''
def func_name(args):
    #do things
    pass

#and to call it:
func_name(values)

#and now lets make an example in order to understand the concept
def multiply(x, y):
    print(x * y)
multiply(4, 2)

'''this will output:
8'''

#lets try something else, lets add so we can print our word that has been given to the function
def say(words):
    print(words)

say("Hello World!")

'''this will output
Hello World!'''

#so now you have gotten into the concept of functions, lets talk about modules! (in our next lesson[file])
