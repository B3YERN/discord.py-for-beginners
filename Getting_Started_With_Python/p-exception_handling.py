'''Hey! This course will teach you on handling an exception:
the method it uses is:
try
except
so now in order to understand, lemme demonstrate it by making an example:'''
try:
    print(1/0)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Divided by zero")

'''this will output:
Divided by zero'''

'''you see the program tries to do the code, the if the error was occured, it prevents it from occuring and does the speci
fic task that was said'''

#so for now you are good to start coding python!! Happy Coding!!
