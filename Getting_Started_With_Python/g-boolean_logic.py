'''Hey There! Lets demonstrate you into boolean logic
now what is this?
bolean logic tells whenever you want the program to do like 'that' or that and that or not that etc.
now the booleans logics are:
and, or, not
now lets give an example in order to understand what do we mean
now lets make a code to tell you if 1 is equal to 1 and 2 is not equal to 1:'''
if 1==1 and 2!=1:
    print("Correct")

#so right lets use or to define this or that statement
if 1==1 or 2==1:
    print("Yes")

#now lets use the not statement
if not 1==2: #this means that if 1==2 is not correct, then print "this is also correct"
    print("this is also correct!")

'''now if you run the code, you will see the following outputs:
Correct
Yes
this is also correct!'''

#in the next one, we will discuss about loops, and this one will be the while loop! So Just hop in!
