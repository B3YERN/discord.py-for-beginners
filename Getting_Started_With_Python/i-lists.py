'''Welcome back, today we will discuss about lists, lists is used to where we sort words and etc.
take this example:'''
list_words = ["Foo", "Baz", "Test", "IDK"]
# ^ is what we call lists and right now we are going to take an print some of the list
# the syntax is: print(name_var[list_num])
print(list_words[0]) #prints first word of the list
print(list_words[1]) #prints second word of the list

#we can also do an empty list, however it will output just only empty
empty = []
print(empty)

#and we can also add a list into a list
lists = ["text", 1, [2, 3, 4], "foo"]
print(lists[1])
print(lists[2][0])

#lists isnt used to store data, however store keywords

#in the next lesson we will teach about for loops! come hop in to see!
