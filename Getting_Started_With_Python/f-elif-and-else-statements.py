'''Welcome back as always! in that lesson we will discuss about elif and else statements
"so what are those?"
lets start with elif statement, elif statement is also short for else if, its used when you have mutiple cases of if statements, it executes only when the first if value is not true, then adds an else if these cases are not true!
The syntax is:'''
if statement:
    #do these tasks
elif statement2:
    #do these tasks
elif statement3:
    #do these tasks
#more elif statements
else:
    #the else goes always last of elif or if and always on bottom on where you want it to state!
    #do these tasks

#Now let's do an example here:
num = 7
if num == 5:
   print("Number is 5")
elif num == 11:
   print("Number is 11")
elif num == 7:
   print("Number is 7")
else:
   print("Number isn't 5, 11 or 7")

'''this will output:
Number is 7'''


#since the point almost goes same for if statement but you got what are the diffrence of them'''

#in the next lesson we will be going through boolean logics, its useful for the program to do the task that i has, you'll see what i mean in the next one!
