'''Hey, welcome back! now lets discuss the most important things about python when you are coding!
if statement:
"so what is it?"
if statement exists in every single language! It allows to tell if a condition is done or exists, then it must do the tasks!
====================================================
the syntax for python is:'''

if condition:
    #do those tasks
'''=================================================
the condition must be the condition you are looking for!
Let's do an example, here i will make a variable named "number" and put it to 5 and we are going to tell the program that if the number is 5, then print "The number is Five":'''
number = 5
if number == 5:
    print("The number is Five")
    
'''this will output as we said last time:
The number is Five
====================================================
lets just say you have number 5 and you tell your if statement that if the number is 6, then the output, Python won't print anything unless it finds it!
[NOTE: We will discuss About else statement in our next lesson in order to tell that if the statement is not true, it must do what the else must do!]'''

'''you can also do as many if statements you want to put in but make sure its idented!
"But wait, wtf is idented?" (call it indentation tbh)
identation is where we tell the if statement by using 4 spaced to tell what to do! that's why it's used to be sorted in python codes!
eg.:'''
num = 6
if num == 6:
    print("Correct")
if num == 7:
    print("Nothing will be printed anyway!")
if num == 8:
    if True:
        print("Still will not be anyway")
  
'''In the next lesson we wil discuss about elif and else statements which elif is almost same as if but its used in a different way and else is used as i said in first note!'''
