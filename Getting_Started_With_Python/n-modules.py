'''Hey There, alright lets start with modules,
so what are modules?
A: Modules is a feature that has built in python in target to improve programming of python and packaging(like discord.py)'''
'''so lets right now make a code using the random module
in this example we will use the module random by importing it, then we will make it so it prints each one randomly'''
import random
lists = ["Foo", "Baz", "Test", "Idk", 1, 2]
print(random.choice(lists))
'''this then will print on what it randomly chooses on the lists
now this basically explains the basic of modules
now lets try doing with maths
lets use for method as followed:'''
from math import pi
print(pi)

'''so that is all about the modules so far, in the next one i will left an txt file of all exceptions list and then the
exception handling!'''
